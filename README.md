## Data Cleansing

The original raw dataset comprised 35 columns and 681,315 rows. I performed data cleaning and restructuring in Excel, following these steps:

- I identified and removed duplicates across all 35 columns. A total of 26 duplicate rows were found and eliminated after ensuring their absence wouldn't interfere with subsequent analysis. Inconsistencies in data, including typos, blank spaces, and punctuation errors, were addressed. The handling of NULL values in crucial columns was thoughtfully considered.
- I divided the data into several tables for more manageable manipulation and analysis. After thorough examination, I created the following tables (the image shows the tables after there were uploading them in Navicat):

## Project summary

This project engages in an in-depth data analysis of electric vehicle title and registration activity in Washington state, based on the dataset found at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-title-and-registration-activity.


## Questions to Answer
**1. Electric Vehicle Adoption:** Analyzing the number of electric vehicles registered to identify trends in adoption over time. 

**2. Electric Vehicles by Alternative Fuel:** Showing the proportion of electric vehicle by Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Type to determinate the popularity by engine type.

**3. Electric Vehicle Sales by Make and Model:** Showing the distribution of electric vehicle sales by make and model to determine the most popular options among buyers. 

**4. New vs. Used Electric Vehicle Sales:** Comparing the number of new versus used electric vehicle sales.

**5. Electric Vehicle Distribution by County and City:** Creating a heatmap or a geographical representation of electric vehicle registrations by county and city to identify areas with higher adoption rates. 

**6. Electric Vehicle Use:** Breaking down the registered electric vehicles by their primary use (personal, commercial, etc.) to understand how they are being utilized.

**7. Average Electric Range by Make and Model:** Comparing the average electric range of different makes and models to identify which vehicles offer the best range.

**8. Impact of Incentives on Sales:** Investigating the relationship between incentive eligibility (based on the electric range, sale date,) and the number of electric vehicles sold.

**9. Electric Vehicle Sales by Legislative District and Electric Utility:** Analyzing the distribution of electric vehicle sales across legislative districts and electric utility service areas to identify areas with stronger support for clean transportation initiatives.

1. From our observations, it's evident that the allure of electric vehicles is steadily growing with each passing year. This upward trend can be attributed to an increasing number of automakers venturing into this industry. As more players enter the market, technology continues to evolve, leading to an expanded assortment of electric vehicle options available for consumers. This broader range provides potential buyers with more choices, catering to various preferences and needs.

Furthermore, our data indicates a strong preference among buyers for new electric vehicles. This inclination not only demonstrates the general population's enthusiasm for cutting-edge technologies but also suggests that the pace of advancements in this field is sufficient to stimulate and maintain interest. The preference for new vehicles is a promising sign, as it implies a readiness to embrace the ongoing evolution in automotive technology, specifically in the realm of electric vehicles. This, in turn, could contribute to further advancements and increased adoption rates, propelling the electric vehicle industry forward.

2. The data at hand reveals a distinct preference among consumers for battery-operated electric vehicles. These vehicles, which run solely on electricity stored in their batteries, constitute the majority of the sales. In fact, plug-in hybrid vehicles - those capable of using both electricity and conventional fuels - account for a mere 31% of the total vehicles sold. This points to a clear trend towards fully electric vehicles, reflecting consumers' growing consciousness about the environment and possibly the improving range and infrastructure for such vehicles.

An interesting outlier in the data is the minimal adoption of hydrogen-powered vehicles. During the period under analysis, a scant total of two hydrogen-powered vehicles were purchased. This number is negligible when compared to the sales of other types of electric vehicles. Factors contributing to this low uptake could include the lack of refueling infrastructure for hydrogen vehicles, their high cost, or simply a lack of awareness about this technology among consumers. Further analysis would be needed to pinpoint the precise reasons, but the current data underscores a strong preference for battery-operated electric vehicles.
